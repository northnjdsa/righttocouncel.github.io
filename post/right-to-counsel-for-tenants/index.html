rate since the pandemic began. In response, the North New Jersey Chapter
of the Democratic Socialists of America (NNJDSA) is organizing a campaign
to pass a “Right to Counsel” (RTC) ordinance in Jersey City.</p><p>RTC refers to government policy that funds free legal representation for
people at risk of losing their homes. Sometimes that risk is due to eviction filing,
a landlord’s failure to make necessary repairs, harassment or discrimination
by a landlord, or any circumstance that may put tenants at risk of being forced
to move.</p><p>The RTC legislation advocated for by NNJDSA and its coalition partners is
modeled after an ordinance passed by the New York City Council in 2017
that resulted in a 30% decline in eviction filings. Before the ordinance was
passed, one percent of tenants facing eviction had legal representation
in housing court. Now, 74% have RTC representation, and 84% of those with
representation stay in their homes.</p><p>“It’s simple. We want to give free lawyers to people at risk of losing their
homes. Anyone who gets served a notice of eviction, give them a lawyer,” said Sarah Levine, an organizer in
NNJDSA’s Jersey City branch. “Moving is expensive and people don’t have other opportunities.
To give them an attorney for free to compel the landlord to bring the building up to code is a key way to make sure people don’t become houseless.”</p><p>The RTC ordinance promoted by NNJDSA would be more inclusive and accessible than the RTC implementations in
NYC, Connecticut, the City of Newark and elsewhere. NNJDSA supports a version that free of eligibility criteria, as
opposed to means-tested policies that exclude large swaths of people.</p><p>The teeth of the reform will be in its funding structure. Organizers intend
the ordinance to be funded through a tax or fee on landlords and development rather than the general budget,
which comes from a property tax levy or federal grants.</p><p>Finally, a RTC ordinance should allow for affirmative cases, which means
tenants would be able to use their RTC-funded lawyer to seek judgment
against a landlord in the event they fail to provide necessary repairs and services
that can render a home uninhabitable. In other RTC programs, tenants
receive free representation only as defendants.</p><p>The housing crisis is reaching a fever pitch as landlords in New Jersey are
raising rents at a higher rate than employers are raising incomes. The $750
million rental and utility assistance program passed in 2021 was designed to
be difficult to obtain for those in most need and temporary for those who receive it. About 58,000 evictions filings
were made in the first seven months of 2022, double the number is the same period last year.
Meanwhile, those limited rental assistance funds are running dry. Making matters worse, courts
have a backlog of more than 31,000 tenancy cases.</p><p>“It’s so expensive to live here. People are selling their homes and others are
being evicted,” said Isaac Jimenez, co-chair of the NNJDSA Hudson County
branch. “RTC speaks to the moment we’re in. While there are many crises
stacked on top of one another right now, the one that allows us to organize for the rest is housing. Keeping
folks where they are is where we start.Developers are taking advantage by upscaling and kicking people out. It’s
happening everywhere.”</p><p>“This campaign really important to working-class people, who are beginning to understand
housing as a human right.” said Jimenez. “This is a form of politics that speaks to the
material needs of our lives, unlike what the Democrats are doing.”</p><p>While a successful RTC campaign would achieve material gains for working-class people, the journey to that
point will build productive and meaningful relationships both within the
chapter and between organizations.</p><p>“RTC has been really great for growing the chapter. It’s a broad-coalition campaign that we need to put our chapter
on the map, especially in off-election cycles,” said Jimenez. “It’s a great way to build trust.”</p></section></div><footer id=footer><section><form method=post action=https://getform.io/f/5ddc2e40-ed41-46fa-95b4-20e576c25701><div class=fields><div class=field><label for=name>Name</label>

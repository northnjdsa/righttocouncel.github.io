Housing is a human right and no one should have to fight for their homes without fair representation. It’s time to demand Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. Let&rsquo;s join <a href=http://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/283/RTC_Enacted_Legislation_in_Eviction_Proceedings_FINAL.pdf>15 cities and 3 states</a> and pass right to counsel. <strong>To fight back against all eviction and displacement we need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants.</strong></p><h2 id=a-right-to-counsel-for-tenants>A right to counsel for tenants</h2><p>While Americans have a right to counsel for criminal proceedings, we only have a patchwork of coverage for representation if threatened with eviction. Like we’re seeing with the many rollbacks of our rights right now, we can’t play the game of “justice by geography.” In 2017 before NYC was the first city to pass a right to counsel, on average, 95% of landlords were represented in court while less than 1% of tenants were. When represented, however, <a href=http://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/275/NCCRC_2021_eviction_RTC_talking_points.pdf>tenants overwhelmingly end up staying in their homes</a>, get more time and money to move, and even avoid getting an eviction on their record. Now <a href=http://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/283/RTC_Enacted_Legislation_in_Eviction_Proceedings_FINAL.pdf>3 states and 15 cities</a> (NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Cleveland and Newark to name a few) have a right to counsel for evictions. Unlike Newark’s ‘right’ to counsel that only covers single person households making under $27,000, we believe a “right” means no means-testing. No evictions without representation. The right should also be a right to affirm tenants rights like hospitality, counterclaims and appeals.</p><h2 id=justice-for-all>Justice for all</h2><p>The housing crisis is a racial justice crisis. The neighborhoods targeted by developers see the highest rate of evictions, and to no surprise they are usually Black, Hispanic/Latino, and other non-White working class communities. <strong>Evictions and illegal rent increases thrust families into <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/no-eviction-without-representation?redirect=evictionbrief">hardship with employment, access to education, loss of benefits, and even securing future housing</a> with an eviction record.</strong> In NYC, the baseline shelter application rate of non-evicted households is 3.4%. Before we build more shelters we need to keep folks in their homes. In Jersey City, the most expensive city for renters, our Right To Counsel ordinance should be funded by corporate landlords and developers. We believe this to be the heart, or the spear, of the policy. Those responsible for this crisis should be the ones that pay, not taxpayers.</p><h2 id=a-plan-to-win>A plan to win</h2><p>Rather than wait for our leaders to figure it out and risk a watered down program, we crafted policy (soon to release) to drastically shift the power imbalance between landlords and tenants. We&rsquo;re not asking for a small check to a non-profit legal service provider. We know we need a publically accountable program, in City Hall. We’re making our politicians choose, either us, or the biggest landlords in the City. We need a bottom-up, grassroots movement to actually win this. <a href=/takeaction>Take action yourself</a> or ask your organization to <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bCq2CavimrqEcziinqsNUi6VhTPvrc1rND_B-Hl3aE/edit>join the coalition</a> to organize and win. Collect petitions, knock doors, and organize tenants to win this ordinance in the City Council. Let’s fight for the Right to Counsel in Jersey City!</p><h2 id=about-dsa>About DSA</h2><p>The Democratic Socialists of America is a nearly 100,000 member strong organization fighting for a political system and economy which works for all. We launched this campaign to be led by tenants, activists and organizations to take power back from landlords, bosses, and politicians, and the few, not the many.

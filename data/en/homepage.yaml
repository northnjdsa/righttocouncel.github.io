- line: "We are in a housing crisis. The pandemic has left millions at risk of losing their homes with rents reaching record highs and evictions exceeding pre-pandemic levels."
- line: "Nationwide, when facing eviction, on average, only 3% of tenants are represented in housing court, compared to 81% of landlords. Housing is a human right and no one should have to  go up in an unfair fight for their homes. It's time Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. We need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants."

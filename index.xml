In response, the North New Jersey Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (NNJDSA) is organizing a campaign to pass a ‚ÄúRight to Counsel‚Äù (RTC) ordinance in Jersey City.
RTC refers to government policy that funds free legal representation for people at risk of losing their homes. Sometimes that risk is due to eviction filing, a landlord‚Äôs failure to make necessary repairs, harassment or discrimination by a landlord, or any circumstance that may put tenants at risk of being forced to move.</description></item><item><title>Right to Counsel Launch and Rally</title><link>https://righttocounseljc.org/post/launch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://righttocounseljc.org/post/launch/</guid><description>üìà Rent is skyrocketing

The right to counsel is a legal guarantee that a tenant will be granted representation by an attorney before they are evicted from their home.
How effective is the right to counsel at preventing evictions?
Studies of the jurisdictions that have passed right to counsel laws all reveal benefits to tenants. When represented through RTC programs, tenants are much more likely to stay in their homes ‚Äî as much as 41% ‚Äî because lawyers can help tenants identify available defenses and resources like rental assistance programs.</description></item><item><title>About Right to Counsel</title><link>https://righttocounseljc.org/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://righttocounseljc.org/about/</guid><description>Nationwide, only 3% of tenants are represented in housing court, while for landlords that‚Äôs more like 81% on average. Housing is a human right and no one should have to fight for their homes without fair representation. It‚Äôs time to demand Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. Let&amp;rsquo;s join 15 cities and 3 states and pass right to counsel. To fight back against all eviction and displacement we need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants.</description></item><item><title>In the Media</title><link>https://righttocounseljc.org/in-the-media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://righttocounseljc.org/in-the-media/</guid><description>Check out the coverage Right to Counsel JC&amp;rsquo;s gotten in the press!

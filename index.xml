We are excited to launch our Right-to-Counsel campaign in Jersey City! Right-to-Counsel is about ensuring tenants receive legal representation with no barriers. People should have the right to be protected from landlord harassment, from eviction to unsafe living conditions.
Join us Sunday, July 24th at noon by City Hall for the inaugural rally.</description></item><item><title>About Right to Counsel</title><link>https://northnjdsa.github.io/righttocounsel.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://northnjdsa.github.io/righttocounsel.github.io/about/</guid><description>Nationwide, only 3% of tenants are represented in housing court, while for landlords that‚Äôs more like 81% on average. Housing is a human right and no one should have to fight for their homes without fair representation. It‚Äôs time to demand Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. We need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants.
A right to counsel for tenants While Americans have a right to counsel for criminal proceedings, we only have a patchwork of coverage for representation if threatened with eviction.</description></item><item><title>Take Action</title><link>https://northnjdsa.github.io/righttocounsel.github.io/take-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://northnjdsa.github.io/righttocounsel.github.io/take-action/</guid><description>We will be hosting city-wide canvasses and phonebanks.

# We are Fighting for Right to Counsel in Jersey City

We are in an eviction crisis. The pandemic has left millions at risk of losing their homes with rents reaching record highs and evictions exceeding pre-pandemic levels. 

Nationwide, only 3% of tenants are represented in housing court, while for landlords that’s more like 81% on average. Housing is a human right and no one should have to fight for their homes without fair representation. It’s time to demand Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. **We need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants.**

JERSEY CITY, MAKE IT OURS

📈 Rent is skyrocketing   
🏘️ Tenants are struggling to keep our housing   
🏗 Corporate landlords are developing us out of our communities   

We are excited to launch our Right-to-Counsel campaign in Jersey City! Right-to-Counsel is about ensuring tenants receive legal representation with no barriers. People should have the **right** to be protected from landlord harassment, from eviction to unsafe living conditions.

Join us **Sunday, July 24th at noon by City Hall** for the inaugural rally. Let us know you're coming to our launch!
